The main page is the index.tsx page inside pages
write npm run dev to work the server and all will appear
the rest of the things i wrote comments for it in each page
i also wrote the code using client side with useffect , but you wanted serverside
i have my other code of client if you want it anytime
the project took from me 5 days with average of 9 hrs a day and that because handling server side problems took time
and also because i made it with client but in a different project file





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
